# Toronto Waste Wizard

This app for people who care about the environment, but don't have enough resources or knowledge to help the environment. 
Most of the time, we are faced with the dilemma of choosing which bin to throw the waste in. And we end up picking the wrong container. Each step, from each individual, will help save our planet. For this reason, this project was born out of need. 
Not only, can we search for everyday things here to Recycle, but also save them for future reference

Types of bin we usually see around are :- Black Bin, Green Bin, Blue Bin
